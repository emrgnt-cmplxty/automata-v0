    ### Introduction:
    {TASK_PROMPT}

    ### Code Instruction:
    Provide a response that completes the following Python code:

    ```python
    {CODE_PROMPT}
    ```

    ### Notes:
    - Respond with the entire complete function definition, including the re-stated function definition, and no other functions or classes.
    - Use only built-in libraries and numpy. Assume no additional imports other than those provided and 'from typing import *'.
    - Optimize your algorithm to run as efficiently as possible. This is a Hard LeetCode problem, so in the vast majority of cases, the appropriate solution will run in \(O(N\log N)\) or faster.
    - Lean heavily on your available functions, `py-set-tests` and `py-set-code-and-run-tests`.
    - Start by re-stating the given tests into the local Python environment, and ensure that your final solution passes all given tests.

    ### Result:
    When you have completed the problem or have run out of allotted iterations or tokens, return a markdown-snippet with your final algorithmic implementation using `call_termination`. Example:

    ```python
    {CODE_PROMPT}
    #.... (Code Continued) ...
    ```

    Your final result should follow EXACTLY the format shown above, except for additional imports that may be added.

    **Example Pattern**

      *User*
        content:
          You are asked to plan a 5-day travel itinerary for a trip to Paris. The trip must include visits to the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame, and other major landmarks, along with fine dining experiences.

          Example 1:
            Day 1: Arrival in Paris, visit Eiffel Tower.
            Day 2: Louvre Museum, Seine River cruise.
            Day 3: Notre-Dame, Montmartre.
            Day 4: Champs-Élysées, fine dining.
            Day 5: Shopping, departure.

          Please provide a detailed plan that considers transportation, accommodation, and time management.

      *Assistant*

          Thoughts:

            The given task requires careful planning to ensure that the traveler enjoys all the major landmarks, local cuisine, and experiences in Paris.

            Key Steps:
              1. Select a centrally located hotel for accommodation.
              2. Plan transportation using the metro system.
              3. Allocate time for each landmark, considering opening hours.
              4. Include fine dining at renowned restaurants.
              5. Consider shopping and leisure time.

            I will call termination and pass back a detailed itinerary to receive further feedback.

          Action:
            function_call:
              {
                'name': 'call_termination', 
                'arguments': '{"result": "Detailed itinerary goes here"}'
              }

      Note, the examples are only provided above to give necessary context around the operating procedure. In production, `# ... (Continued interaction) ...` will be replaced with actual conversation contents. 
      
      You will be graded on your ability to successfully execute the exact request provided by the user. You may receive feedback at the start of this session from past attempts taken by similar agents.
